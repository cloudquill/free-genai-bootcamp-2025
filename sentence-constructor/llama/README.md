## Which model
Llama-3.1-405B

Apart from the generalized tip often given to improve prompts, Meta suggests useful techniques to improve the performance and expected outcome from Llama:
- Prompting using Few-Shot Learning: shots are examples of the type of prompt and response you expect from a LLM. In Few-Shot Learning, providing
  specific examples will result in more consistent and accurate outputs.

Notes:
This model fails to get the correct translation for words. Might need a database mapping common words to their igbo translations?
